        <section>
          <p>Definition of Scrum</p>
          Scrum is a project management methodology based on Agile principles. It provides teams the ability to work in
          increments and focuses on delivering maximum value to the customer.
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Key goals and advantages of the methodology</p>
          The goal of Scrum is to simplify the development process by providing structured roles, events, and artifacts.
          Its advantages include increased transparency, improved team efficiency, and a more flexible approach to
          project management.

        <section>
          <p> The Scrum Team consists of three key roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <em>Scrum Master</em> - ensures understanding and adherence to Scrum, helps the team overcome
              obstacles.</li>
            <li><em>Product Owner</em> - defines product requirements, manages the Product Backlog, prioritizes tasks.
            </li>
            <li><em>Developers</em> - a team of specialists responsible for task execution during a sprint.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Increments and Sprints</p>
          Scrum is based on incremental product development. An increment is a part of the product that delivers real
          value to the customer. It is formed by completing tasks within one sprint.
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog</p>
          The Product Backlog is a dynamic list of tasks and product requirements, continuously updated to reflect new
          needs or priorities. The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks selected by the team for completion during the
          current sprint.

          <p>What is a Sprint?</p>
          A sprint is a fixed time period, usually 1 to 4 weeks, during which the team works on tasks from the Sprint
          Backlog.
          The purpose of a sprint is to create an increment of the product that can be demonstrated to the customer. The
          sprint duration is determined by the team and remains unchanged throughout the project.

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li> <em>The Sprint Planning</em> - is an event where the team determines which tasks will be completed
              during the next sprint and defines the expected outcome.S</li>

            <li><em>The Daily Scrum</em> - is a short daily event where each team member reports on their progress,
              discusses any challenges, and plans the day's work.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li><em>The Sprint Review</em> - is a Scrum event held at the end of each sprint to demonstrate and
              discuss the product increments developed by the development team. Key participants include the development
              team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, customer, and other stakeholders, providing an opportunity for feedback
              and collaboration to evaluate the progress and make decisions about the product.</li>
            <li><em>The Sprint Retrospective</em> - is a meeting held after each sprint to reflect on what went well,
              what could be improved, and what changes can be made in the next sprint.</li>
          </ul>

            <li> <em>The Product Backlog</em> - is a dynamic list of tasks and requirements ordered by priority,
              continuously
              updated based on changing needs.</li>

            <li><em>The Sprint Backlog</em> - is a list of tasks selected by the team for completion during the current
              sprint. </li>

            <li> <em>The Increment</em> - is the result of the team's work during the sprint, which should be
              potentially
              shippable to the customer. Each Increment must be fully completed and tested.</li>
